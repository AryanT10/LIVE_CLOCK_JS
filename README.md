# LIVE_CLOCK_JS
# Revolving RED, BLUE , GREEN GRADIENT  CSS

I was thinking to make some projects in my study week just to practice so i thought lets make something 
simple like a live clock .

This Project code provides a stylish and eye-catching revolving Red, Blue, Green  gradient effect. It is 
designed to be used in web projects where a dynamic and visually appealing background is desired. The 
gradient smoothly transitions between black and white colors, creating an elegant and modern appearance.

This project was mainly for the practice of intensive CSS features and learning through it.
## Key Features
- **Revolving Effect:** The gradient background rotates in a circular motion, adding a sense of movement 
and dynamism to the design.
- **Gradient:** The gradient consists of a smooth transition between RBG 
colors, creating a classic and minimalist aesthetic.
- **Animated Text:** The time and date elements have animated effects that enhance the overall visual 
experience.
- **Easy to Use:** The CSS code is simple and can be easily integrated into your project by linking the 
stylesheet.

## Usage
1. Copy the CSS code and save it in a CSS file.
2. Link the CSS file in your HTML document using the `<link>` tag.
3. Apply the appropriate class and element selectors to your HTML markup to utilize the styling.

Feel free to customize the code further to suit your specific project requirements. Enjoy the elegant 
revolving black and white gradient effect in your web design!
